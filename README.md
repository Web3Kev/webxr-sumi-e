# 🖌️ WebXR Sumi-e

**WebXR Sumi-e** is a small experiment exploring how traditional Japanese **sumi-e** (ink painting) can be translated into a 3D drawing experience using WebXR.

It works in AR/VR headsets and lets users draw brush-like strokes in 3D space using controllers or in your browser with a mouse or with touch.
