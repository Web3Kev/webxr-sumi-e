# 🖌️ WebXR Sumi-e

**WebXR Sumi-e** is a small experiment exploring how traditional Japanese **sumi-e** (ink painting) can be translated into a 3D drawing experience using WebXR.

It works in AR/VR headsets and lets users draw brush-like strokes in 3D space using controllers or in your browser with a mouse or with touch.

## 🎮 Controls (Headset)

- **Draw:** Use controllers  
- **Button A:** Undo last stroke  
- **Button B:** Clear all strokes  
- **Button Y:** Increase brush size  
- **Button X:** Decrease brush size  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frameworks:** React, React Three Fiber, React XR  
- **State Management:** Jotai  
- **Language:** TypeScript  
- **Assets:** Skybox (top hemisphere) modeled and hand-painted in Blender  

---

## 🗓️ TODO

- [ ] Implement **mobile AR drawing** support  
- [ ] fix orbit control to target and revolve around center of bounding box of drawn strokes

---

## 💡 Future Ideas

- 🌐 Multiplayer networking for collaborative drawing  
- 📦 Export drawings to **OBJ** or **USDZ**  
- 🔁 Stroke playback/replay  
- 🉐 Kanji character recognition  
- implement on 2D desktop mobile experience the same technique as feather 3D (ipad app) using planes to draw
